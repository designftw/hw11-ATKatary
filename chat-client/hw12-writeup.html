		<h2>Final design</h2>
		The final design I plan to turn in will be what I currently have but extended to channels (or groups, time permitting) with
		some of the current bugs fixed. The main features will be
		<ul>
			<li>Creating customized notification schedules for entire channels rather than individuals</li>
			<li>Providing better notification UI to showcase that a new message was sent</li>
		</ul>
		Additionally, I will fix the minor computation bugs and figure out a better solution to getting number 
		of unread messages. I will also add support for sending and recieving messages

		<h2>What I did in this submission</h2>
		In this submission, I implemented customizable notifications for individuals. I created a component called Schedule 
		which allows me to specify the notification schedule for an individual. I was able to get the notifications api to 
		send notifications when a message was recieved but I decided to hold off on making it only notify when the time 
		is within the specified range. The reason for this choice is for the next step I would need to handle the logic
		differently as it would be the union of all possible schedules. This submission was meant to be a proof of concept
		for extending my idea to channels and I was able to implement the scheduler and integrate it with graffiti. 
		There are currently some minor bugs with the current version, for instance the total number of unread counter is a bit hacky. 
		Moreover, I currently do not support sending and recieving images privately because it is not an important part of my 
		design and I wanted to focus on the scheduler.
